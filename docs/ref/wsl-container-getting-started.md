# WSLC Getting Started — Running Linux Containers from Windows via MXC

> **Audience:** MXC consumers

This guide walks you through setting up the WSL Container (WSLC) backend for
MXC, which lets you run Linux containers on Windows using the WSLC SDK.

> **Note:** WSLC is a stable v0.9 backend and does not require a runtime
> experimental opt-in. Rust/native builds still require the compile-time
> `wslc` feature and the external WSLC SDK/runtime prerequisites below.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| **Windows 10 1903 (build 18362.1049)+ on x64, or Windows 10 2004 (build 19041)+ on ARM64** | WSL 2's own [system requirements](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/install-manual#step-2---check-requirements-for-running-wsl-2). MXC does not check the OS version itself — see [How an unsupported Windows version is reported](#how-an-unsupported-windows-version-is-reported) below. The WSL runtime package installs only on build 19041 and later, so in practice a 1903/1909 host still needs an upgrade to reach the WSL version below. |
| **WSL 2.9.9+** | The installed WSL runtime package must meet the WSLC minimum; see Step 1 below for installation |
| **WSLC SDK** | `wslcsdk.dll` is a separate client SDK and must be in the same directory as the running executable (`wxc-exec.exe`, or your own binary when using the Rust SDK) |
| **Container images** | Reachable from a registry, already cached, or supplied as a local tar |

### How an unsupported Windows version is reported

MXC deliberately carries **no minimum-Windows-version check** of its own. Hardcoded
build floors would duplicate requirements that WSL owns and revises, and the WSL
tooling already reports them, so MXC asks the WSLC SDK instead of the OS.

The single host gate is `WslcGetMissingComponents()`, called from
`wslc_common::is_available()` — which backs the `platform_support()` (Rust) /
`GetPlatformSupport()` (C#) and `available_backends()` probes — and again from
each backend preflight before a container is created.

On a host too old for WSL 2, the WSL runtime package cannot be installed, so that
call reports `WslPackage` (and usually `VirtualMachinePlatform`) missing. The
practical consequences are:

- the platform-support probes omit `wslc` from the available backends, and
- a WSLC run fails with the `WSLC runtime unavailable` error below, whose guidance
  points at `wsl --update`.

Running `wsl --update` on such a host is what surfaces the version verdict, from
WSL itself:

```text
Windows version 10.0.<build> does not support the packaged version of Windows Subsystem for Linux.
Install the required update via Windows update or via: <KB link>
For information please visit https://aka.ms/wslinstall
```

The WSLC SDK carries the same verdict as an HRESULT. `wslcsdk.dll` statically links
WSL's service-connect guard, which raises `WSL_E_OS_NOT_SUPPORTED` (`0x80040327`)
when the host is neither Windows 11 nor has the WSL support interface — or
`WSL_E_WSL_OPTIONAL_COMPONENT_REQUIRED` (`0x80040321`) when the legacy `lxss`
optional component is absent as well. Any SDK call that reaches the WSL service
can return it, so an unexpected `0x80040327` from a WSLC operation means the host
OS is below WSL 2's floor, not that WSL is merely uninstalled.

## Step 1 — Install WSL 2.9.9+

The WSLC SDK requires WSL version 2.9.9 or later. Update WSL to the latest
version. Note that 2.9.9 may only be available on the pre-release channel
until it reaches the default Store channel, so include `--pre-release`:

```powershell
wsl --update --pre-release
```

Verify your WSL version after updating:

```powershell
wsl --version
```

The WSL version should be **2.9.9.0 or later**. If `wsl --update --pre-release`
does not bring you to the required version, build WSL from the `master`
branch:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/WSL.git
cd WSL
git checkout master
```

Follow the build instructions in the WSL repository README to build and install.

> **Note:** Building the WSL repo installs the **WSL runtime** (the system
> service). This is separate from `wslcsdk.dll`, which is the client SDK
> library. The DLL is bundled in the `mxc-sdk` package under `build/wslc_common/` and
> is automatically extracted when you build MXC with `--with-wslc` (Step 2).

## Step 2 — Build MXC with WSLC support

Build `wxc-exec.exe` with the `wslc` feature flag. This compiles the WSLC
backend and copies `wslcsdk.dll` next to the binary:

```powershell
cd <repo-root>
.\build.bat --with-wslc
```

Verify the binary starts without errors:

```powershell
.\src\target\x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\release\wxc-exec.exe --help
```

> **Note:** paths in this guide use the x64 target directory. On an ARM64 host
> `build.bat` targets `aarch64-pc-windows-msvc`, so substitute that directory.
> The WSLC scripts under `scripts\` and `tests\scripts\` pick the host-arch
> directory themselves.

> **Note:** `wxc-exec.exe` does **not** require `wslcsdk.dll` at startup. The
> DLL is loaded at runtime only when the WSLC backend is invoked. All other
> backends (Process Container, Windows Sandbox) work without it.

## Step 3 — Container images (optional pre-pull)

A run pulls its image on a cache miss, so you can skip straight to
Step 4. Pre-pulling is still worth doing in two cases: to keep the
download off the critical path of a later run, and to populate a cache
for a host that cannot reach a registry.

```powershell
cd <repo-root>
.\scripts\setup-wslc.ps1 -Image alpine:latest, python:3.12-alpine
```

Or pull a single image directly:

```powershell
.\src\target\x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\release\wxc-exec.exe `
    --setup-wslc --image alpine:latest
```

Pulled images persist in the cache until you remove them — pay the
cost once per image, not once per run.

> **Storage path consistency:** the cache lives under the WSLC
> `storage_path` (default `%TEMP%\mxc-wslc-sessions`). If your runtime
> configs override `wslc.storagePath`, pass the same
> value here with `-StoragePath` (or `--storage-path` on
> `wxc-exec.exe`), otherwise the runner will not find what you just
> pulled and will pull it again under its own path.

> **Bring-up reaches the network.** A cache miss makes the host fetch
> from the image's registry before the container starts. That fetch is
> outside the sandbox's own network policy, so a config declaring
> `network.egress.default: "deny"` is **refused** rather than pulled —
> warm the cache first, or set `wslc.imageTarPath`. A config that
> allows egress pulls on a miss.

### Limiting which registries a machine may use

An administrator can restrict runtime pulls to named registries with a
`REG_MULTI_SZ` value under the machine policy key:

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Mxc
    WslcAllowedImageRegistries  (REG_MULTI_SZ)
        docker.io
        mcr.microsoft.com
```

A reference with no registry (`alpine:latest`) resolves against
`docker.io`. With no value configured the machine is unmanaged and any
registry may be used. A value that exists but cannot be read permits
**nothing**, so a misconfigured policy denies rather than silently
falling open. The allowlist governs runtime pulls only; `--setup-wslc`
and `wslc.imageTarPath` are unaffected.

See [`wslc-registry-allowlist-policy.md`](wslc-registry-allowlist-policy.md)
for the full administrator reference, including deployment and verification.

### How long a pull may take

A single pull is bounded at 540 seconds; `MXC_WSLC_PULL_TIMEOUT_SECS`
overrides it.

An image pull during `provision` must also finish at least 60 seconds before
the client's daemon-call deadline, so that a slow registry causes a failed provision
rather than a timeout that abandons a container. Raising the budget past
540 seconds on that path therefore needs
`MXC_WSLC_DAEMON_CALL_TIMEOUT_SECS` (default 600) raised with it.

## Step 4 — Verify WSLC is working

Run the included hello world example config from the repo root:

```powershell
cd <repo-root>
.\src\target\x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\release\wxc-exec.exe --debug examples\wslc_hello_world.json
```

Expected output:

```
Hello from WSL Container!
Linux <hostname> 6.6.x-microsoft-standard-WSL2 ... x86_64 Linux
```

## Warming the cache

The day-to-day flow is a single command:

```powershell
.\src\target\x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\release\wxc-exec.exe my-config.json
```

The first run of a given image pays for its download; later runs read
it from the cache. To pay that cost ahead of time instead — or to
prepare a machine that will run offline — warm the cache first:

```powershell
.\scripts\setup-wslc.ps1 -Image <image>
```

## Usage

### TypeScript SDK

Create a V1 `ContainerRequest` with WSLC configuration and use `spawn`
for live output:

```typescript
import { spawn, type ContainerRequest } from '@microsoft/mxc-sdk/v1';

const request: ContainerRequest = {
  containment: {
    type: 'wslc',
    config: { image: 'python:3.12-alpine', cpuCount: 2, memoryMb: 1024 },
  },
  command: 'python3 -c "print(\'Hello from WSLC\')"',
  network: {
    egress: { default: 'allow' },
    ingress: { default: 'allow', hostLoopback: 'allow' },
  },
  timeoutMs: 30_000,
};

const child = await spawn(request);
try {
  child.standardOutput?.on('data', (data) => process.stdout.write(data));
  child.standardError?.on('data', (data) => process.stderr.write(data));
  console.log(await child.wait());
} finally {
  child.dispose();
}
```

WSLC SDK execution uses standard output/error streams and does not expose a
caller-controlled PTY or stdin.

### Rust SDK

The Rust SDK (`mxc-sdk`) runs WSLC **in-process** — it does not spawn
`wxc-exec.exe`. Build the crate with its `wslc` feature, select the backend with
`Containment::Wslc`, and run the request directly:

```toml
# Cargo.toml
[target.'cfg(target_os = "windows")'.dependencies]
mxc-sdk = { path = "…/src/mxc-sdk", features = ["wslc"] }
```

```rust
use mxc_sdk::v1::{self, configs::WslcConfig, ContainerRequest, Containment};

let wslc = WslcConfig {
    image: "python:3.12-alpine".to_string(),
    cpu_count: Some(2),
    memory_mb: Some(1024),
    ..Default::default()
};
let request = ContainerRequest {
    containment: Containment::Wslc(wslc),
    ..ContainerRequest::new("python3 -c \"print('Hello from WSLC')\"")
};

// Run to completion, capturing output…
let output = v1::run(request.clone(), Default::default())?;
println!("{}", String::from_utf8_lossy(&output.stdout));

// …or stream it live (read stdout/stderr while it runs, kill it, wait).
let mut process = v1::spawn(request, Default::default())?;
let stdout = process.take_stdout().expect("stdout");
```

`WslcConfig` mirrors the `wslc` settings below;
`WslcConfig::default()` matches the SDK default (`alpine:latest`). The typed
request is validated by the same native engine as executor requests.

Notes and limits:

- **Windows only.** Selecting `Containment::Wslc` on Linux/macOS, or without the
  `wslc` feature, fails with `ErrorCode::UnsupportedContainment`.
- **No stdin.** The WSLC SDK exposes no process-input API, so
  `Sandbox::take_stdin()` returns `None` for a WSL container.
- **No host pid.** The process runs inside the WSL VM, so `Sandbox::id()` is `0`;
  use `kill()` (which stops the container and everything in it) to terminate it.
- **Discovery.** `platform_support()` lists `"wslc"` in `available_methods` only
  when this host can actually run it (`wslcsdk.dll` loads and the WSLC runtime
  reports no missing components).

## Configuration Reference

### JSON config

WSLC-specific settings go under `wslc` in the JSON config:

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `image` | string | `"alpine:latest"` | Container image (DockerHub, GHCR, MCR, etc.) |
| `cpuCount` | number | Host default | Number of CPU cores for the container |
| `memoryMb` | number | Host default | Memory limit in MB |
| `gpu` | boolean | `false` | Enable GPU passthrough |
| `storagePath` | string | System default | Host path for container storage (VHD) |
| `imageTarPath` | string | — | Path to a local tar file to import as the image |
| `portMappings` | array | `[]` | Host→container TCP forwards; each entry takes `windowsPort` and `containerPort` |

### Port mappings

```json
"wslc": {
    "portMappings": [
        { "windowsPort": 8080, "containerPort": 80 }
    ]
}
```

TCP only — the WSLC SDK runtime returns `E_NOTIMPL` for UDP, so a `"udp"`
protocol is rejected. Two entries claiming the same `windowsPort` are also
rejected.

The separate `provision` operation takes the same list under
`wslc.provision.portMappings`, which requires schema `1.1.0-alpha`:

```json
{
    "version": "1.1.0-alpha",
    "phase": "provision",
    "containment": "wslc",
    "wslc": {
        "provision": {
            "portMappings": [
                { "windowsPort": 8080, "containerPort": 80 }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

The lifecycle daemon creates one container per sandbox, so a forward belongs
to the sandbox that declared it. The session-wide `cpuCount` / `memoryMb` /
`gpu` / `storagePath` settings remain available only for create-and-run execution, because that daemon shares a
single WSL session across every sandbox.

### Image sources

> The store is consulted first in every case. A miss pulls from the
> registry, except with `imageTarPath`, which imports the tar instead.
> See [Step 3](#step-3--container-images-optional-pre-pull) for warming
> the cache ahead of time.

**1. From DockerHub (default registry):**

```json
"wslc": { "image": "alpine:latest" }
```

**2. From a custom registry (no auth):**

```json
"wslc": { "image": "ghcr.io/linuxserver/baseimage-alpine:3.21" }
```

Tested registries: DockerHub, `mcr.microsoft.com`, `ghcr.io`, `quay.io`.
Private registries needing credentials are not supported yet; pre-pull
those out of band or supply a tar.

**3. Import from a local tar file (never touches a registry):**

```json
"wslc": {
  "image": "my-image:latest",
  "imageTarPath": "C:\\path\\to\\image.tar"
}
```

Both `docker export` (rootfs) and `docker save` (image archive) formats are
supported — the format is auto-detected. Tar import happens on first use;
no separate `--setup-wslc` step is required.

### Network configuration

| Exact v0.9 policy | WSLC behavior |
|---|---|
| Egress, ingress, and host-loopback defaults all `allow` | Bridged networking without independent directional filtering |
| All three defaults `deny` (also the omitted defaults) | No networking (isolated) |
| Mixed allow/deny directions or egress rules | Rejected; WSLC cannot enforce that combination |

> **No per-host filtering primitive exists.** The container lacks
> `CAP_NET_ADMIN`; MXC refuses unsupported rules rather than running them
> unenforced. The removed legacy `allowOutbound` setting and JSON host-list
> fields are not accepted by any supported contract.

### Network proxy (cooperative, unprivileged)

WSLC supports a **cooperative HTTP/HTTPS proxy**: setting `runtimeConfig.networkProxy`
routes a container's egress through a proxy you provide. WSLC cannot apply an
`iptables` drop-floor — the container has no `CAP_NET_ADMIN` and MXC has no
VM-level enforcement hook — so
enforcement is *cooperative*, applied by handing the workload proxy environment
variables that well-behaved clients honor.

**How it works**

1. When `runtimeConfig.networkProxy` is set, the runner translates it into the
   `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `http_proxy`, and `https_proxy` environment
   variables inside the container (via `WslcSetProcessSettingsEnvVariables`).
   Any caller-supplied values for these keys — including `NO_PROXY` /
   `no_proxy` — are **stripped** from the *initial* process environment first.
   Because WSLC merges the process environment onto the image's baked-in
   `ENV`, the runner also sets `NO_PROXY` / `no_proxy` to the **empty string**,
   so an image-baked exemption (e.g. `ENV NO_PROXY=*`) cannot silently disable
   the proxy. This sanitizes the process's *starting* environment only; see the
   cooperative-model caveat below.
2. Cooperative tools (curl, wget, Python `requests`, Node `https`, etc.) honor
   the env vars and their traffic flows through the proxy.

**The runtime field contains a URL string.** A WSLC container runs in its own
network namespace (a separate WSL system VM). Its own `127.0.0.1` loopback is
valid for a proxy running inside that container, as in the test fixture below;
a proxy on the host's or WSL distro's loopback is **not reachable**. An external
proxy must have an address routable from the container:

```json
{
  "version": "0.9.0-alpha",
  "containment": "wslc",
  "process": { "commandLine": "curl -fsSL https://example.com && echo OK" },
  "network": {
    "egress": { "default": "allow" },
    "ingress": { "default": "allow", "hostLoopback": "allow" }
  },
  "runtimeConfig": { "networkProxy": "http://proxy.example:8080" },
  "wslc": { "image": "alpine:latest" }
}
```

The removed `network.proxy` object and its `localhost`/`builtinTestServer`
forms are rejected by schema `0.9.0-alpha`. Create-and-run proxy use requires the unrestricted
bridged posture shown above; a proxy cannot make isolated networking reach an
external listener. Execution in an existing container (`exec`) instead supplies only `runtimeConfig` and
inherits its provisioned network posture.

### Per-host filtering is not supported

WSLC **cannot** enforce per-host egress filtering. Directional allow/deny rules
would require in-container `iptables`
rules, but a WSLC container runs **without** `CAP_NET_ADMIN` (the SDK's
`Privileged` flag does not grant it), so those rules cannot be applied — and MXC
has no VM-level enforcement hook either (WSLC cannot expose one without breaking
other security promises such as MDE). Rather than fail the run at exec time,
such configs are **rejected before provisioning**:

```
WSLc does not support network.egress allow/deny rules; networking is all-or-nothing
```

Use a runtime proxy with unrestricted bridged networking for cooperative host
filtering at the proxy layer. Without filtering rules, v0.9 accepts isolated
deny/deny/deny or unrestricted allow/allow/allow across egress, ingress, and
host-loopback. Mixed directions are rejected because no independent restriction
primitive exists.

### Retired enforcement and inbound fields

Pre-v0.9 published contracts are immutable history but fail at exact-version
dispatch. In supported contracts, `network.enforcementMode`,
`network.allowLocalNetwork`, host lists, and `network.proxy` are unknown fields
and fail structural parsing; there is no legacy `"capabilities"` selector.
Use the directional all-allow or all-deny posture above. Inbound reachability
requires explicit host-to-container forwards through `wslc.portMappings`
(create-and-run execution) or `wslc.provision.portMappings` (container lifecycle operations);
`ingress.default: "allow"` alone does not create them.

**Caveats**

- **Cooperative model, not enforcement.** Only clients that honor the proxy
  env vars are routed through the proxy. Tools that bypass them (raw sockets,
  custom HTTP clients, statically-linked binaries that ignore the env) are
  **not** contained. WSLC cannot provide a hard network floor — the container
  has no `CAP_NET_ADMIN` and MXC has no VM-level enforcement hook. For strict
  network isolation in v0.9, use the deny/deny/deny posture instead.
- **Consumer-provided proxy.** MXC does not start a proxy for WSLC; you supply
  a reachable URL via `runtimeConfig.networkProxy`. Host filtering is the
  proxy's responsibility; directional rules cannot be combined to create a
  firewall WSLC does not have.

### Filesystem mounts

Paths in `filesystem.readwritePaths` and `filesystem.readonlyPaths` are mounted
into the container. Host path `C:\workspace` becomes `/mnt/c/workspace` inside
the container.

### Working directory (`process.cwd`)

Create-and-run execution takes `process.cwd` as a local Windows drive path and maps it the
same way: `C:\workspace` starts the process in `/mnt/c/workspace`. Grant the
directory in `filesystem` so it is mounted. A value that cannot be mapped —
a relative, drive-relative (`C:work`), UNC, or in-container path such as
`/workspace` — is **rejected** before the container is created. An omitted or
blank `cwd` leaves the container's default working directory in place.

Execution in an existing container (`exec`) takes the opposite form: an absolute in-container path such
as `/work`.

### Environment

From schema `0.9.0-alpha` `process.env` and `process.inheritDefaultEnv` combine
as below. The backend default is the **container image's own `ENV`** — MXC
neither authors nor enumerates it, so what those rows give you depends on the
image you chose:

| `process.env` | `inheritDefaultEnv` | MXC gives the child |
|---|---|---|
| omitted | ignored | the image's `ENV` |
| `[]` | `false` (default) | nothing |
| `[]` | `true` | the image's `ENV` |
| `["FOO=bar"]` | `false` (default) | only `FOO` |
| `["FOO=bar"]` | `true` | the image's `ENV`, plus `FOO`; a caller entry wins |

`inheritDefaultEnv` layers the supplied entries over the image's `ENV`, so
supplying none of them asks for that environment itself.

Below `0.9.0-alpha` an omitted and an empty `process.env` are treated alike, and
the caller's entries always layer over the image's `ENV`.

The table is what MXC supplies, which is not all the workload observes. The
command line runs under the image's `/bin/sh`, and a shell started without a
`PATH` falls back to a compiled-in one — on the Alpine images that is
`/sbin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin`. So in the two replacing rows `ls` still
resolves, while an interpreter the image installed elsewhere (`python3` under
`/usr/local/bin`) does not. Such a workload needs `PATH` in `process.env` or
`inheritDefaultEnv`. The same shell also fabricates `PWD` and `SHLVL`, so no
row reads back as a truly empty environment from inside the container.

`WslcSetProcessSettingsEnvVariables` layers its entries over the image's `ENV`
and the SDK offers no call that clears it, so the two replacing rows launch the
workload through `env -i` instead. An entry naming no variable (`"FOO"` rather
than `"FOO=bar"`) is dropped, as it is on every other backend.

> **A replacing row puts every entry on the container's command line.** `env -i`
> takes them as arguments, so each `NAME=VALUE` is readable from inside the
> container through `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` for as long as the command runs, and
> appears wherever that container's process list is captured. The entries are
> not exposed to the Windows host — the container runs in its own WSL VM — and
> MXC does not log them. Pass a secret through `inheritDefaultEnv` instead,
> which hands it to the SDK's environment setter and keeps it off the command
> line, or supply it to the workload through a mounted file.

`runtimeConfig.networkProxy` is an exception to every row: its variables are
injected, and any caller-supplied proxy variable is scrubbed, whatever
`process.env` asks for. Egress policy is enforced cooperatively through those
variables, so a verbatim environment cannot be used to opt out of it. Because
MXC injects the proxy URL itself, a replacing row cannot choose to keep it off
the command line — so a URL holding `user:pass@` credentials is rejected there
rather than exposed.

### `ui` is not supported

A `ui` section is **rejected** — the backend has no mechanism to enforce UI
restrictions on a container.

The check is on **presence, not value**. `ui`'s defaults are full lockdown, so
an explicitly supplied lockdown `ui` is indistinguishable *by value* from an
absent one — a value-based check would let the single most restrictive request
you can write through unenforced. Omit the section entirely.

### `lifecycle`: only `destroyOnExit: true` is supported

`lifecycle.destroyOnExit: true` (the default) is honored: it selects the SDK's
`WSLC_CONTAINER_FLAG_AUTO_REMOVE`, and teardown stops and deletes the container.

`lifecycle.destroyOnExit: false` is **rejected**. It asks for the container to
outlive the run, which create-and-run execution cannot deliver on this backend: the container is
scoped to a session this process owns, terminating that session at the end of
the run reaps the container regardless of the AutoRemove flag, and the WSLC SDK
has no cross-process re-attach. Use manual lifecycle operations if you need a
container to persist — its daemon holds the session open across phase processes.

`lifecycle.preservePolicy: true` is **rejected** — WSLC has no
policy-persistence primitive, so there is nothing for the flag to select.

Container lifecycle JSON requests differ: they reject the whole `lifecycle` section
at parse time, because a multi-invocation sandbox's lifetime is driven by the
explicit `provision` / `deprovision` phases rather than by per-run flags.

## Supported workloads

MXC's Linux container support is **language-agnostic**. The image defines the
capabilities, not MXC: any workload that runs on Linux, exits on its own, and
produces output via stdout/stderr is supported. That covers interpreted scripts
(`python:3.12`, `node:20`), compiled binaries (`golang:1.22`, `gcc:latest`),
shell automation (`alpine`, `ubuntu:22.04`), .NET on Linux, and private
registry images carrying your own toolchain.

Four workload shapes are not:

| Workload type | Why |
|---|---|
| Interactive processes (REPLs, shells) | MXC does not pass stdin — execution is fire-and-forget |
| GUI applications (X11, Wayland) | No display server — MXC captures stdout/stderr only |
| Long-running daemons (web servers, databases) | MXC expects the process to exit within the configured timeout |
| Hardware access (USB, serial, Bluetooth) | The micro-VM does not expose host hardware beyond filesystem and network |

GPU compute is supported with `"gpu": true`, which passes through the host GPU
via the SDK's `ENABLE_GPU` container flag and requires a GPU-capable host.

### What the image must provide

MXC runs the workload's command line as `/bin/sh -c`, and a request that
supplies `process.env` without `inheritDefaultEnv` runs that shell through
`/usr/bin/env`. An image supplying neither path — `scratch` and most distroless
images — cannot be used.

## Troubleshooting

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `WSLC backend not compiled` | Binary built without `--features wslc` | Rebuild with `build.bat --with-wslc` |
| `WSLC runtime unavailable` **on a host below WSL 2's minimum Windows version** | The WSL runtime package cannot install on this OS, so it reports as missing — MXC does not distinguish the two cases | Run `wsl --update`; WSL reports the version verdict ("Windows version {} does not support the packaged version of Windows Subsystem for Linux"). Upgrade Windows — see [How an unsupported Windows version is reported](#how-an-unsupported-windows-version-is-reported) |
| HRESULT `0x80040327` (`WSL_E_OS_NOT_SUPPORTED`) from any WSLC call | The SDK reached WSL's service-connect guard on a host that is neither Windows 11 nor has the WSL support interface | Upgrade Windows. `0x80040321` (`WSL_E_WSL_OPTIONAL_COMPONENT_REQUIRED`) is the sibling code when the legacy `lxss` component is absent too |
| `Failed to load wslcsdk.dll` | DLL not in same directory as `wxc-exec.exe` | Copy `wslcsdk.dll` next to the binary |
| `WSLC runtime unavailable` | WSL runtime package is missing, older than 2.9.9, or the Virtual Machine Platform optional component is disabled | Update WSL with `wsl --update --pre-release`, verify the installed version with `wsl --version`, and enable the Virtual Machine Platform optional component if required. The WSLC SDK DLL is a separate dependency and does not replace the WSL runtime package. |
| `WSLC runtime unavailable. Missing components: SdkNeedsUpdate` | The opposite direction: your installed WSL is **newer** than the WSLc SDK this MXC build ships (specified by `WSLC_SDK_VERSION` in `src/mxc-sdk/build/build_wslc_common.rs`) | Update MXC to a build that includes a newer SDK. Do **not** update WSL — it is already ahead, and updating it further will not clear this. |
| `WSLC image '<name>' is not cached, and this sandbox declares no egress` | An isolated config named an image the store does not have | Warm the cache with `--setup-wslc`, set `imageTarPath`, or allow egress |
| `WSLC image '<name>' cannot be pulled: '<host>' is not in the administrative registry allowlist` | Machine policy restricts which registries may be used | Use a permitted registry, set `imageTarPath`, or ask an administrator to widen `WslcAllowedImageRegistries` |
| `WSLC image '<name>' did not finish pulling within <n>s and was stopped` | The pull exceeded its budget and was aborted | Retry, raise `MXC_WSLC_PULL_TIMEOUT_SECS`, or warm the cache from a faster network |
| `WSLC image '<name>' did not finish pulling within <n>s. The transfer was abandoned` | The registry stopped responding, so the pull was given up on rather than ended | Retry, or warm the cache from a faster network. For a separate `provision` operation, raise `MXC_WSLC_DAEMON_CALL_TIMEOUT_SECS` alongside `MXC_WSLC_PULL_TIMEOUT_SECS`, since the pull must finish before the daemon-call deadline |
| `WSLC image '<name>' could not be pulled` with `repository does not exist or may require 'docker login'` | The reference is wrong, or the registry needs credentials MXC cannot supply | Fix the image name and tag. For a private registry, use `imageTarPath` or import the image out of band |
| `WSLC image '<name>' could not be pulled` with `no such host` or a connection error | This host cannot reach the registry | Restore network access, or warm the cache from a connected machine with `--setup-wslc` and match `storagePath`. `imageTarPath` removes the dependency entirely |
| `WSLC image '<name>' could not be pulled` with `HRESULT 0x8004060D` | Administrative policy on the host blocks the registry | Use a permitted registry, or supply the image with `imageTarPath` |
| Container exits with code -1 | Process failed or timed out | Check stderr output with `--debug` flag |

## Maintaining the SDK bindings

The WSLC SDK FFI bindings (`wslcsdk_sys.rs`) are **generated by bindgen** from
the SDK header and committed to the repo. For how they work and the exact
procedure to follow on every SDK version bump, see
[WSLC SDK bindings runbook](../../development/build-and-test/wslc-sdk-bindings.md).
