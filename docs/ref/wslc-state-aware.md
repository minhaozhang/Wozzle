# WSLc Container Lifecycle Operations

> **Audience:** MXC consumers and developers

This document describes **container lifecycle operations** for the WSL Container (WSLc) backend:
`provision → start → exec → stop → deprovision` calls that keep a
container running across separate `wxc-exec` phase processes, avoiding repeated
WSLc startup costs. See the [consumer glossary](../../glossary.md) for terminology.

It complements:

- [WSLC SDK bindings runbook](../../development/build-and-test/wslc-sdk-bindings.md) — regenerating the SDK bindings.
- [Container lifecycle architecture](../../development/architecture/container-lifecycle.md) — the shared lifecycle JSON format, the Rust `StatefulSandboxBackend` trait, and backend routing.

WSLc lifecycle ["MXC request JSON"](../../schema.md#mxc-request-json) is supported by published contracts
beginning with `0.9.0-alpha`. The Rust, .NET, and Node high-level v1 lifecycle
APIs use stable contract `1.0.0`; callers do not
supply a schema version. Neither path requires a runtime experimental opt-in.
Native builds still require the `wslc` feature (`build.bat --with-wslc`).

## Why a daemon

The WSLc SDK (`wslcsdk.dll`, 2.9.9) has **no cross-process session re-attach**: every operation
(`WslcCreateContainer`, `WslcStartContainer`, `WslcCreateContainerProcess`, image pull, stop /
delete) requires a live in-process `WslcSession` / `WslcContainer` handle, and there is no
`WslcOpenSession`. Each lifecycle phase runs as a **separate**
`wxc-exec` invocation, so handles minted during `provision` cannot be reused by a later `exec`
or `deprovision` in a different process.

> SDK 2.9.9 added `WslcOpenContainer` (open an existing container by name, full ID, or unique ID
> prefix). That is a *container*-level primitive and still requires a live session handle in the
> calling process, so it does not by itself remove the need for the daemon. Whether a fresh
> per-phase session plus `WslcOpenContainer` could replace the warm-handle model has not been
> evaluated; the daemon remains the supported design.

To keep the session (VM) and container **warm** across phases, WSLc uses a **persistent per-user
daemon** (`wxc-wslc-daemon.exe`, an `mxc-sdk` binary target at
`src/mxc-sdk/src/bin/wslc_daemon/`) that owns
the live SDK handles. Each phase process is a thin client that contacts the daemon over a named
pipe; the daemon performs the actual SDK calls and streams stdio back. This mirrors the Windows
Sandbox daemon pattern.

The daemon owns the live SDK handles on a **single apartment-affine worker thread**, which services
every lifecycle command. Any thread that has joined the MTA may use those handles, so an image
pull and an `exec` each run on an MTA thread of their own and post their outcome back to the
worker, leaving it free to serve other sandboxes for the duration of a run. A second `exec` on a
container with a run in flight is refused as `busy`; a lifecycle command naming that container
waits for the run, because deleting the container would free a handle the run is using. See
[Known limitations](#known-limitations).

## Components

| Component | Location | Role |
|-----------|----------|------|
| Lifecycle backend | `src/mxc-sdk/src/backends/wslc/common/state_aware.rs` (`WslcStateAwareRunner`) | Translates runtime `WslcProvisionConfig` and shared policy fields into daemon protocol frames; implements `StatefulSandboxBackend` (`ID_PREFIX`/`BACKEND_KEY` = `wslc`). |
| Policy support checks | `src/mxc-sdk/src/backends/wslc/common/policy.rs` | Per-phase validation of which policy fields are enforced or rejected. |
| Daemon client | `src/mxc-sdk/src/backends/wslc/common/daemon_client.rs` | Discovers / spawns the daemon, connects the control pipe, sends `DaemonRequest` frames, reads responses; typed `DaemonError`. |
| Daemon | `src/mxc-sdk/src/bin/wslc_daemon/` (`wxc-wslc-daemon.exe`) | Long-lived host process holding `WslcSession` / `WslcContainer`; worker thread drives the SDK; idle-timeout watchdog tears the session down when unused. |
| Engine routing | `src/mxc-sdk/src/core/mxc_engine/state_aware.rs` | Selects the WSLc lifecycle backend (Windows + `wslc` feature). |
| Prefix registration | `src/mxc-sdk/src/tools/mxc_common/state_aware_dispatch.rs` (`backend_from_prefix`) | Maps the `wslc:` id prefix back to the WSLc backend for post-provision phases. |

Version-specific adapters construct `mxc_common::models::WslcProvisionConfig` directly from
`wslc.provision`. Conversion to the backend's typed configuration preserves an absent
config, a present empty config, and supplied
`image`/`imageTarPath`/`portMappings` values without reparsing JSON. An omitted
image remains `None` until the backend chooses its default. Each version's JSON
request type is converted once by its adapter; the backend uses the runtime
`WslcProvisionConfig` model rather than deserializing JSON again.

### Port mappings

`wslc.provision.portMappings` forwards host ports into the sandbox's container,
using the same entry shape as the create-and-run `wslc.portMappings` list:

```json
{
    "version": "1.1.0-alpha",
    "phase": "provision",
    "containment": "wslc",
    "network": {
        "egress": { "default": "allow" },
        "ingress": { "default": "allow", "hostLoopback": "allow" }
    },
    "wslc": {
        "provision": {
            "portMappings": [
                { "windowsPort": 8080, "containerPort": 80 }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

Port mappings require bridged networking. A request that leaves `network` out,
or sets it to the all-`deny` isolated posture, is rejected at provision: the
container has no networking for a forward to reach.

The field requires development contract `1.1.0-alpha`. Requests declaring
`0.9.0-alpha` cannot include it and must select `1.1.0-alpha` explicitly.
The daemon shares one session (VM) but creates a separate container for each
provision, so a mapping applies only to the container that declared it, unlike
the session-wide `cpuCount` / `memoryMb` / `gpu` / `storagePath` knobs that
remain available only for create-and-run execution.

The create-and-run `wslc.portMappings` list and `wslc.provision.portMappings` share
one duplicate check, so two entries claiming the same `windowsPort` are
rejected identically. Zero ports and non-TCP protocols are rejected when the
version-specific JSON request is deserialized.

The forward listens on `127.0.0.1` only, so a mapped port reaches the container
from the host itself and not from other machines. WSLC installs it when the
container starts rather than at provision, so a `windowsPort` that another
process already holds on loopback fails the `start` phase, not `provision`.

## Sandbox IDs

`provision` mints an id of the form `wslc:<32 lowercase hex>` (`wslc:` + a UUID simple form).
"MXC request JSON" carries this id in `sandboxId` for every post-provision phase
(`start` / `exec` / `stop` / `deprovision`). Direct `wxc-exec` calls omit it from JSON and pass it
as `--container-id`; the dispatcher derives the backend from the `wslc:` prefix (later operations do
**not** repeat `containment`).

## Phase → WSLc SDK mapping

| Phase | Daemon action (WSLc SDK) |
|-------|--------------------------|
| provision | Load SDK, `WslcCreateSession`, resolve/import image, `WslcCreateContainer` with a keepalive init process (so the container survives across separate `exec` phases). The container is created **not started** (`started: false`). |
| start | `WslcStartContainer` — starts the container minted at provision-time (the keepalive init keeps it warm across later `exec` phases); marks it `started`. |
| exec | `WslcCreateContainerProcess` in the warm container; stream stdout/stderr and return the process exit code. Stdin is unavailable because the WSLc SDK exposes no process-input API. A timeout or caller cancellation SIGKILLs the **process**, not the container. |
| stop | `WslcStopContainer`. |
| deprovision | `WslcDeleteContainer`; release the session + SDK when the last container is gone (daemon may then exit / idle-time out). |

### exec output semantics

`provision` / `start` / `stop` / `deprovision` return a JSON object containing `result` or `error` on stdout.
For `wxc-exec` CLI execution, a **successful** `exec` relays the script's raw stdout/stderr live
from daemon frames and exits with the script's own exit code — it does **not** wrap the result in
a JSON result object. A CLI dispatch **failure** writes its `{error}` JSON object to stderr, because the
script's output may already own stdout by the time the failure is known. In-process SDK execution
uses the supported streaming APIs, which return separate stdout/stderr pipes; no stdin pipe is
returned. Rust and .NET SDKs do not expose attached exec as a public operation. A timeout on the
CLI attached relay surfaces as a backend error because that path cannot return a typed timeout;
the streaming path reports it through its wait result.

### exec admission, cancellation, and failure containment

The daemon admits up to eight exec streams at once, one per container. A second
exec naming a container that already has one in flight is refused with `busy`
before any admission reaches the client; the outward SDK error is
`backend_error`. The bound of eight comes from memory: a streaming exec's output
lives only in its bounded live-output queue, so the persistent per-user daemon
stays near 128 MB of live output even against clients that never drain. An
exec's slot is held until the run has reported back and its client has been
written to, so a client that disconnects mid-run keeps counting against that
bound while its process is still going, and one that drains slowly keeps
counting while its output is still queued. A run whose termination could not be
confirmed leaves its sandbox quarantined and keeps the slot until that sandbox
is deprovisioned, because the process may still be alive.

Three conditions surface as `busy`, and all reach an SDK caller as
`backend_error`:

| Condition | Message | Retry |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The daemon's eight exec slots are all occupied | `WSLc daemon exec capacity is exhausted` | Succeeds once any exec finishes |
| The named container already has an exec in flight | `sandbox <id> already has an exec in flight` | Succeeds once that container's run finishes |
| Every client slot is occupied and the request is not a cancellation | `WSLc daemon client capacity is exhausted` | Succeeds once any client disconnects |

Up to eight additional control connections can be serviced while every exec slot
is occupied. Beyond that, a connection is admitted only to cancel: cancellation
is the one request that never waits on the worker, and the only way to end a run
with no timeout, so it keeps capacity of its own that lifecycle work cannot
consume. A connection on that lane must send its request within two seconds and
in under 1 KB, so one that connects and stalls cannot hold a cancellation slot
for the general deadline.

`start` / `stop` / `deprovision` naming a container with an exec in flight
**wait** for that run, because deleting the container would free a handle the
run is still using.

Each exec carries an internal ID and per-run token. A duplicate live ID is
rejected, and cancellation must match both values so a delayed cancellation
cannot terminate a later run that reused the same ID. Cancellation observed
before the worker starts a queued command returns a typed cancelled result
without creating the process.

Live output uses bounded queues in both the daemon and the in-process native
pipe bridge. If a caller does not drain stdout/stderr quickly enough, excess
output is dropped and the run is reported as truncated; incomplete output is
never reported as successful. A run that would otherwise have exited cleanly
becomes an explicit backend error carrying the process's exit code in
`details.exitCode`. A run that timed out or was cancelled keeps that outcome —
truncation is reported alongside it rather than replacing it. For an in-process
piped caller that pairing is only available on a clean exit: `ExecOutcome` has no
field for a modifier, so a piped run that both timed out and truncated reports
only the timeout.

If process termination cannot be positively confirmed after creation, the
container is quarantined and cannot be started or used for another exec. The
daemon attempts immediate deletion. If deletion fails, the quarantined entry is
retained so `deprovision` can retry cleanup; it is not removed from tracking
while a potentially running workload remains.

## Supported and rejected policy fields

WSLc networking is **all-or-nothing** (`WslcContainerNetworkingMode` `None` vs
`Bridged`); there is no per-host filtering or independent ingress/host-loopback
restriction primitive. Proxy configuration supplies environment variables, not
a firewall. Schema `0.9.0-alpha` supports two combinations:

| Posture | `egress.default` | `ingress.default` | `ingress.hostLoopback` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Isolated | `deny` | `deny` | `deny` |
| Bridged, unrestricted | `allow` | `allow` | `allow` |

Omitted directional values default to deny, so an egress-only allow request is
rejected rather than claiming its implicit ingress/loopback denies are enforced.
Mixed postures and per-host rules are rejected. Allowing ingress/host-loopback
does not create host port forwarding or promise reachability across NAT; it
acknowledges that WSLC cannot independently restrict those directions.

| Field | provision | start / stop / deprovision | exec |
|-------|-----------|----------------------------|------|
| `readwritePaths` / `readonlyPaths` | honored → container volumes | rejected | rejected |
| `deniedPaths` | rejected if overlapping/nested under a mount (a standalone denied path is accepted); no Deny primitive | rejected | rejected |
| Directional `network` posture | deny/deny/deny → isolated; allow/allow/allow → bridged | rejected | rejected; inherit provision posture |
| `network.egress.allow` / `deny` rules | rejected | rejected | rejected |
| Legacy `network` fields | structurally rejected in v0.9 | structurally rejected | structurally rejected |
| `runtimeConfig.networkProxy` | structurally rejected | structurally rejected | honored as a routable URL, injected as `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` env vars |
| `ui` | rejected | rejected | rejected |
| `process.env` / `process.inheritDefaultEnv` | n/a | n/a | honored → see [Environment](wsl-container-getting-started.md#environment) |
| `process.timeout` | n/a | n/a | honored → `ExecConfig.timeout_ms` |
| `lifecycle` | rejected (whole section, at parse) | rejected | rejected |

For "MXC request JSON" declaring `0.9.0-alpha`, that version's request type is selected before
backend execution. High-level v1 SDK calls select contract `1.0.0` internally.
Fields not declared for that phase are rejected during parsing with
`malformed_request`: provision excludes `ui`, start / stop / deprovision admit
no filesystem, network, UI, or process policy, and exec excludes filesystem and
UI. These failures do not reach WSLc's presence checks.

Fields allowed by that phase's JSON request type still receive backend validation.
Every resulting `policy_validation` above aborts the phase before anything is
created: the dispatcher runs each `validate_*` hook ahead of the phase body,
and `connect_daemon()` lives inside `provision()`, so a refused provision never
spawns the daemon, VM, or container.

Filesystem policy is fixed at `provision` and immutable afterwards.

The directional network posture is fixed at `provision`. Post-provision
phases reject supplied posture by presence, even when values equal defaults.
Only exec can supply a cooperative proxy through top-level `runtimeConfig`;
its request omits `network` so proxy-only execution inherits the existing
posture. Proxy URLs must address a listener reachable from the guest; a host
loopback listener is not made guest-reachable by spelling its host address
`localhost`.

The legacy `defaultPolicy`/`network.proxy` vocabulary documented in older
published contracts is not a v0.9 compatibility fallback. The new v0.9
directional requirements do not change those published contracts.

## Error mapping

JSON parsing failures reported as `malformed_request` occur before daemon connection and
are not part of daemon error mapping. Once dispatch reaches the backend,
`state_aware.rs::map_daemon_error` maps daemon errors to the shared SDK error codes:

| Source | SDK error code |
|--------|-----------------|
| daemon `ErrKind::NotProvisioned` (incl. stale / deprovisioned id) | `not_provisioned` |
| daemon `ErrKind::NotStarted` | `not_started` |
| daemon `ErrKind::Unavailable` (host cannot run WSLc) | `backend_unavailable` |
| daemon `ErrKind::Rejected` (request the backend refuses as written) | `policy_validation` |
| daemon `ErrKind::Busy` / `NotReady` / `Protocol` / `Backend` / `Unknown`, or `DaemonError::Transport` | `backend_error` |
| `DaemonClient::connect` failure (no reachable daemon) | `backend_unavailable` |
| WSLc feature absent / host cannot run WSLc | `backend_unavailable` |

The daemon classifies each failure from the `failure_phase` its step helper
reported, so a phase failure reaches the SDK with the same code that
create-and-run execution returns for the same host condition. A caller branches on the code
without matching the message.

`ErrKind` is additive: a kind a client does not recognize decodes to
`ErrKind::Unknown` and maps to `backend_error`, so a daemon from a newer
install degrades to the previous behavior instead of failing the decode. Adding
a kind therefore needs no `PROTOCOL_VERSION` bump.

## Daemon idle-timeout env overrides

The daemon tears its session down after an idle period (default **300s**, polled every **15s**). Both
are overridable via environment (positive integer seconds; unset / empty / non-numeric / zero fall
back to the default). The daemon inherits the environment of the phase process that spawns it, so a
caller sets these before the first `provision`:

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `MXC_WSLC_DAEMON_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECS` | `300` | Idle duration after which the daemon tears down the session. |
| `MXC_WSLC_DAEMON_IDLE_POLL_SECS` | `15` | How often the idle watchdog checks for inactivity. |

The lifecycle end-to-end test script (`tests/scripts/run_wslc_state_aware_tests.ps1`) uses short overrides so
it can observe idle-teardown within seconds.

## Testing

`tests/scripts/run_wslc_state_aware_tests.ps1` is the multi-invocation E2E harness (requires a WSL2
host that can reach a registry or already has the image cached, and `wxc-wslc-daemon.exe` staged next to `wxc-exec.exe`). It exercises
core lifecycle, warm-reuse (a marker written by one `exec` is read back by a separate `exec`
process — only possible if the container stayed warm), filesystem volumes, bridged networking +
proxy, validation rejections, exec concurrency, and idle teardown. Fixtures live in
`tests/configs/wslc_state_aware_*.json`.

The concurrency section launches a phase without waiting for it (`Start-StateAware` /
`Wait-StateAware`), which is what lets it observe two sandboxes running at once, a refused
same-container second exec, and a lifecycle command issued while a run is in flight. Every other
section drives one phase process at a time.

### Running the fixtures (ordering + id substitution)

The `wslc_state_aware_*.json` test inputs describe **container lifecycle operations**: unlike create-and-run configs, they cannot be
run individually or in an arbitrary order:

- **Order is mandatory.** A sandbox must go through `provision → start → exec… → stop → deprovision`.
  `provision` is what boots the session and mints the id; every other phase fails without it
  (`start`/`exec` before provision → `not_provisioned` / `not_started`, and any phase after
  `deprovision` → `not_provisioned`).
- **The id must be threaded through.** `provision` returns the real `wslc:<32-hex>` id on stdout
  (`result.sandboxId`). The post-provision fixtures (`_start`, `_stop`, `_deprovision`, and every
  `_exec_*`) ship with a literal **`{{SANDBOX_ID}}` placeholder**. These test inputs use
  "MXC request JSON"; the harness replaces the placeholder before converting the request to
  direct executor CLI form.

`run_wslc_state_aware_tests.ps1` handles both concerns automatically (it drives the phases in order
and does the `{{SANDBOX_ID}}` substitution from each provision's output). It then removes `phase`
and `sandboxId` from the JSON and passes them as `--operation` and `--container-id`. Exercise these
fixtures **through the harness**, not by pointing `wxc-exec --config` at them directly.

## Known limitations

- **Ordering is per-container, not global.** A lifecycle command naming a container with a run in
  flight waits for that run; commands for other sandboxes proceed independently. A caller cannot
  infer that work on one sandbox completed because work on another did.

- **`busy` collapses to `backend_error` (deferred).** A refused exec reaches an SDK caller as a
  generic `backend_error` with no indication that retrying would succeed. A retryable error code
  needs a new `MxcErrorCode` variant, whose predefined values match the SDK `ErrorCode` union
  one-for-one, so it spans Rust, Node, .NET, the versioned references, and schema regeneration.
  This is tracked as follow-up work.

- **No typed SDK can set port mappings yet.** The Rust, Node, and .NET v1 SDKs
  all use published stable contract `1.0.0`, which does not declare the
  field, and released schemas are immutable. "MXC request JSON" using contract `1.1.0-alpha` through the
  FFI or `wxc-exec` is the only way to reach it today. Promoting `1.1.0-alpha`
  to a stable release is what lets the three SDKs expose it together.
